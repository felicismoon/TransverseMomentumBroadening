**These projects study the transverse momentum broadening of protons in a CLAS6 experiment. All of these projects read 3 ntuple HIPO files for Carbon, Iron, and Lead data.**

**NuCounts4FINAL.jsh**: This project creates 4 graphs of ΔpT² vs. Atomic Number for 4 equal bins of the nu data. The first bin contains 1/4 of the data with the lowest values of nu and the last bin contains 1/4 of the data with the highest values of nu. 

**NuVspT2FINAL.jsh**: This project creates 3 graphs of ΔpT² vs. nu for each of the 3 elements studied. 

**Q2Counts4FINAL.jsh**: This project creates 4 graphs of ΔpT² vs. Atomic Number for 4 equal bins of the Q² data. The first bin contains 1/4 of the data with the lowest values of Q² and the last bin contains 1/4 of the data with the highest values of Q². 

**Q2VspT2FINAL.jsh**: This project creates 3 graphs of ΔpT² vs. Q² for each of the 3 elements studied. 

ZhCounts4FINAL.jsh: This project creates 4 graphs of ΔpT² vs. Atomic Number for 4 equal bins of the zh data. The first bin contains 1/4 of the data with the lowest values of zh and the last bin contains 1/4 of the data with the highest values of zh. 

ZhCounts6FINAL.jsh: This project creates 4 graphs of ΔpT² vs. Atomic Number for 6 equal bins of the zh data. The first bin contains 1/6 of the data with the lowest values of zh and the last bin contains 1/6 of the data with the highest values of zh. 

ZhCounts6betterfitFINAL.jsh: This project creates 4 graphs of ΔpT² vs. Atomic Number for 6 equal bins of the zh data. The first bin contains 1/6 of the data with the lowest values of zh and the last bin contains 1/6 of the data with the highest values of zh. This project also creates logarithmic and power series fits for these plots and prints the equations of these plots.  

ZhVspT2FINAL.jsh: This project creates 3 graphs of ΔpT² vs. zh for each of the 3 elements studied. 

pT2FINAL.jsh: This project creates 6 histograms of the ΔpT² data for the deuterium target carbon, heavy target carbon deuterium target iron, heavy target iron, deuterium target lead, and heavy target lead. This project also creates a graph of ΔpT² vs. Atomic Number for all of the data. 

pT2betterfitFINAL.jsh: This project creates a graph of ΔpT² vs. Atomic Number for all of the data with logarithmic and power series fits. The project also prints the equations of these lines of fit. 

pT2withZh6andNu4FINAL.jsh: This project creates 6 graphs of ΔpT² vs. Atomic Number for 6 equal bins of the zh data. Within each bin of zh, the data is further divided into 4 bins of the nu data. This results in graphs that have 12 points in total: 4 for each Atomic Number, where each point corresponds to the value of ΔpT² for that bin of the nu data. 

pT2withZh6andQ23FINAL.jsh: This project creates 6 graphs of ΔpT² vs. Atomic Number for 6 equal bins of the zh data. Within each bin of zh, the data is further divided into 3 bins of the Q² data. This results in graphs that have 9 points in total: 3 for each Atomic Number, where each point corresponds to the value of ΔpT² for that bin of the Q² data.

pT2withZh6andQ24FINAL.jsh: This project creates 6 graphs of ΔpT² vs. Atomic Number for 6 equal bins of the zh data. Within each bin of zh, the data is further divided into 4 bins of the Q² data. This results in graphs that have 12 points in total: 4 for each Atomic Number, where each point corresponds to the value of ΔpT² for that bin of the Q² data.
